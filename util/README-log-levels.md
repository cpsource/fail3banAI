Yes, `MaxLevelKMsg=info` is high enough to capture the `iptables` log messages with `--log-level 4` because:

- `log-level 4` corresponds to `warning`, which is more severe than `info` (level 6).
- `MaxLevelKMsg=info` means that all kernel messages at the level of `info` (6) or higher severity (lower number) will be captured.

### Allowable Log Levels for `MaxLevelKMsg`

The kernel log levels range from 0 to 7, with 0 being the most critical. Here's a breakdown of the allowable levels:

| Log Level Number | Log Level Name | Description             |
|------------------|----------------|-------------------------|
| 0                | `emerg`        | Emergency: system is unusable |
| 1                | `alert`        | Action must be taken immediately |
| 2                | `crit`         | Critical conditions      |
| 3                | `err`          | Error conditions         |
| 4                | `warning`      | Warning conditions       |
| 5                | `notice`       | Normal but significant condition |
| 6                | `info`         | Informational messages   |
| 7                | `debug`        | Debug-level messages     |

Since you are using `--log-level 4` in your `iptables` rule, which is `warning`, all log levels 4 (`warning`) and higher severity (i.e., 3 to 0) will also be captured.

### Summary:
- `MaxLevelKMsg=info` (level 6) will capture all logs from `info` and more severe log levels (`notice`, `warning`, `err`, etc.).
- Since `iptables` logs are set with `--log-level 4` (which is `warning`), they will be captured because `info` allows for logs at level 6 and lower (i.e., higher severity).

If you want to capture everything, including debug messages, you can set `MaxLevelKMsg=debug` (level 7), but for your current setup, `info` is more than sufficient.
