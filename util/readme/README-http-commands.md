In addition to **GET** and **POST**, there are several other HTTP methods (also known as HTTP verbs) commonly used in RESTful APIs and web development. Here’s a list of the key methods:

1. **PUT**: 
   - Used to update an existing resource or create a new resource at a specific URL. If the resource exists, it will be updated; if it does not exist, it will be created.
   - Example use case: Updating a user’s profile information.

2. **DELETE**: 
   - Used to delete a specified resource from the server.
   - Example use case: Removing a blog post from a website.

3. **HEAD**: 
   - Similar to GET, but it only retrieves the headers without the response body. Useful for checking if a resource exists or fetching metadata about a resource.
   - Example use case: Checking the modification date of a resource before downloading it.

4. **PATCH**: 
   - Used to apply partial updates to a resource. Unlike PUT, which replaces the entire resource, PATCH modifies only specific fields.
   - Example use case: Updating just the email field of a user profile without affecting other fields.

5. **OPTIONS**: 
   - Returns the allowed methods for a specific resource or server, letting the client know which HTTP methods are available (e.g., GET, POST, etc.).
   - Example use case: Determining what operations are allowed on a user resource (GET, POST, DELETE).

6. **TRACE**: 
   - Used for diagnostic purposes. It performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource, showing how the request has been modified by intermediate servers.
   - Example use case: Debugging issues in routing or request handling.

7. **CONNECT**: 
   - Primarily used with proxies to establish a tunnel to a server, often used for HTTPS requests.
   - Example use case: Setting up an encrypted connection to a remote server through a proxy.

Each HTTP method serves a distinct purpose in the communication between a client and a server, allowing for a wide range of operations such as resource creation, retrieval, updating, deletion, and more.
