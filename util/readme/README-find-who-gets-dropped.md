To find the Ubuntu task or process responsible for generating a network packet that was dropped (or otherwise blocked), you can use a combination of tools such as `netstat`, `ss`, `lsof`, `conntrack`, or advanced logging techniques with `iptables` and `auditd`. Here's a general approach to trace the task or process:

### 1. **Use `netstat` or `ss` to Find Connections**
   You can use the `netstat` or `ss` command to list current network connections and processes associated with them. These tools help you match network traffic with process IDs (PIDs).

   #### `ss` (Socket Statistics):
   ```bash
   sudo ss -tnp
   ```

   This will show TCP connections (`-t`), not listening sockets (`-n`), along with the associated process (`-p`):
   - Look for the specific IP address, port, or state of the dropped connection.
   - Example output:
     ```
     State      Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address:Port    Peer Address:Port    Process
     ESTAB      0      0      192.168.1.100:52038  93.184.216.34:80     users:(("curl",pid=3098,fd=3))
     ```

   - The **Process** column will show the name of the process, its PID, and file descriptor. You can use the PID to identify the task using `ps`.

   #### `netstat`:
   ```bash
   sudo netstat -tnp
   ```

   This will show similar output to `ss` with connections and associated PIDs.

### 2. **Log Dropped Packets with `iptables`**
   If you are dropping packets using `iptables`, you can add a logging rule to log dropped packets. Once you log the packet details, you can correlate it with the process by matching source IP/port information.

   - Add a logging rule before the `DROP` rule in your `iptables` configuration:
     ```bash
     sudo iptables -I OUTPUT 1 -p tcp --dport <port> -j LOG --log-prefix "Dropped packet: "
     ```

   - After logging is enabled, check the logs for dropped packets:
     ```bash
     sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog
     ```

   This will give you detailed information about the dropped packet, such as source IP, destination IP, and port numbers, which you can use to identify the responsible process using `ss` or `netstat`.

### 3. **Find Process by Port Using `lsof`**
   `lsof` can list open files, including network sockets. You can use it to find the process that has a specific network port open:

   ```bash
   sudo lsof -i :<port>
   ```

   Replace `<port>` with the port number involved in the dropped packet. Example:
   ```bash
   sudo lsof -i :80
   ```

   The output will show the PID and process name associated with that port.

### 4. **Monitor Connections with `conntrack`**
   If you are using connection tracking (`conntrack`), you can list active connections and their states, which might help in identifying the packet that was dropped:

   ```bash
   sudo conntrack -L
   ```

   Look for the dropped connection by matching the source/destination IP and port. If connection tracking is enabled, it will show more detailed information about connection attempts.

### 5. **Use `auditd` to Monitor System Calls**
   If you want to go a step further and track the system calls related to dropped packets, you can use the `auditd` tool to monitor the system for network-related activities:

   - Install `auditd` if it's not already installed:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install auditd
     ```

   - Create a rule to monitor network-related system calls, like `connect`:
     ```bash
     sudo auditctl -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S connect -k net-connect
     ```

   - Check the audit logs for network-related events:
     ```bash
     sudo ausearch -k net-connect
     ```

   This can help identify which processes are attempting to establish network connections, allowing you to correlate with the dropped packet.

### 6. **Use `ps` to Find More Information on the PID**
   Once you have the process ID (PID) from the previous steps, you can use `ps` to find more detailed information about the task:

   ```bash
   ps -fp <pid>
   ```

   Replace `<pid>` with the process ID. This will show details like the command that started the process, the user running it, and more.

### Example Workflow:

1. **Log the Dropped Packet**: Set up `iptables` logging for dropped packets.
2. **Identify Process**: Use `ss`, `netstat`, or `lsof` to find the process responsible for the blocked connection using the logged IP/port information.
3. **Trace the Task**: Use `ps` or other commands to gather more information about the process.

By following these steps, you should be able to find the task or process responsible for generating a packet that was dropped in your `OUTPUT` chain.
