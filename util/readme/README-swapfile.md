To mount a swap file (`/swapfile`) using `/etc/fstab`, you need to add an entry for it in the file. Here's the step-by-step process:

### 1. **Check if Swap File Exists**
Ensure that the swap file has been created and activated:

```bash
sudo fallocate -l 1G /swapfile  # Example to create a 1GB swap file
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile         # Set proper permissions
sudo mkswap /swapfile            # Set up the swap area
sudo swapon /swapfile            # Enable the swap file
```

You can verify that the swap file is active by running:

```bash
sudo swapon --show
```

### 2. **Edit `/etc/fstab`**

Open `/etc/fstab` in a text editor:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/fstab
```

### 3. **Add the Swap File Entry**

Add the following line to mount the swap file automatically at boot:

```bash
/swapfile none swap sw 0 0
```

### Explanation:
- `/swapfile`: The path to your swap file.
- `none`: No specific mount point, as it's a swap file.
- `swap`: The file system type is swap.
- `sw`: The options for swap space.
- `0 0`: These values are for the `dump` and `fsck` options, which are not needed for swap files.

### 4. **Test the `/etc/fstab` Configuration**

To test that the `/etc/fstab` entry is correct without rebooting, run:

```bash
sudo mount -a
```

This will mount all filesystems listed in `/etc/fstab`, including your swap file.

### 5. **Verify Swap File**

You can verify that the swap file is active and listed by running:

```bash
sudo swapon --show
```

After adding the entry, the swap file will automatically be enabled at boot.
