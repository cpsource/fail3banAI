Message: AVC apparmor="DENIED" operation="capable" class="cap" profile="/snap/snapd/22991/usr/lib/snapd/snap-confine" pid=1343 comm="snap-confine" capability=38  capname="perfmon"

Meaning:
The message you're seeing is being generated by **AppArmor**, which is a Linux security module, and it is related to a process (`snap-confine`) that is being denied a specific capability (`perfmon`). Let's break it down:

### Message Breakdown:

- **AVC apparmor="DENIED"**: This indicates that **AppArmor** is denying a particular operation. AVC stands for **AppArmor Violation Control**, similar to "Access Vector Cache" in SELinux terms.
  
- **operation="capable"**: This means that a capability (privilege) check was performed, and it was denied.
  
- **class="cap"**: Refers to the capability class in this instance.
  
- **profile="/snap/snapd/22991/usr/lib/snapd/snap-confine"**: This indicates the AppArmor profile responsible for applying restrictions. The profile in question is the one for **`snap-confine`**, a part of the **Snap package manager** infrastructure.

- **pid=1343**: The process ID (`1343`) that triggered the denial.

- **comm="snap-confine"**: The command or executable name, which in this case is `snap-confine`. This is a utility used by **Snap** to set up the confined environment for applications running in Snap packages.

- **capability=38 capname="perfmon"**: This indicates that the denied capability was `perfmon` (performance monitoring). Capability 38 corresponds to `CAP_PERFMON`, a Linux capability that allows a process to access certain performance monitoring features (used by tools like `perf`).

### What’s Happening:

- The process `snap-confine` (part of the Snap package management system) is trying to use the **`CAP_PERFMON`** capability.
- AppArmor is denying the request because the profile for `snap-confine` does not allow the use of that capability.
- `CAP_PERFMON` allows processes to access performance monitoring, and Snap packages are generally confined to strict AppArmor profiles for security, which blocks access to such capabilities unless explicitly allowed.

### Who is Generating the Message?

- **AppArmor** is the entity generating this denial message. AppArmor logs such events when a program tries to perform an operation outside the restrictions defined by its security profile.
  
- The **specific process triggering the event** is `snap-confine`, which is attempting to access the `perfmon` capability, likely on behalf of some Snap application.

### Possible Solutions:

1. **Ignore the Message**: If the denied operation doesn't affect the functionality of the Snap application, you could ignore the message. It's an AppArmor enforcement mechanism designed to restrict unnecessary privileges.

2. **Allow the Capability**:
   - If you trust the Snap package and want it to access the performance monitoring capability, you would need to adjust the AppArmor profile for `snap-confine` to allow `CAP_PERFMON`. However, this is not recommended unless you're sure about the implications on security.
   - Snap applications are typically confined for security reasons, so modifying the AppArmor profile might reduce the security of your system.

3. **Filter or Suppress the Message**: If you don't want to see these messages in the logs but don’t want to adjust the profile:
   - You can modify audit rules (as mentioned in earlier responses) to filter out these AppArmor denial logs.
   - Alternatively, you can configure `journalctl` to filter them out if you don't want them in your system logs.

In summary, **AppArmor** is generating this message due to the denial of the `CAP_PERFMON` capability request by `snap-confine`. This is part of normal AppArmor enforcement, and how you proceed depends on whether you want to allow, suppress, or ignore this event.
