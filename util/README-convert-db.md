# SQLite to MariaDB Migration Script

This script automates the process of dumping a table from an SQLite3 database, converting it to a MariaDB-compatible format, and importing it into a MariaDB database. The script can be run from the command line with arguments specifying the SQLite database file and the table name.

## Prerequisites

### 1. Environment Variables
The script requires several environment variables for connecting to the MariaDB database. These should be defined in a `.env` file located in the user's home directory (`$HOME/.env`).

The required environment variables are:

- `MARIADB_USER_NAME` – The MariaDB username.
- `MARIADB_USER_PASSWORD` – The MariaDB password.
- `MARIADB_USER_HOST` – The MariaDB host (e.g., `localhost` or IP address).
- `MARIADB_USER_PORT` – The port for connecting to MariaDB (e.g., `3306`).
- `MARIADB_USER_DATABASE` – The target MariaDB database where the table will be imported.

### 2. Dependencies

Ensure that the following Python packages are installed:

- `sqlite3` (part of the standard Python library)
- `mysql-connector-python` (for connecting to MariaDB)
- `python-dotenv` (for loading environment variables from `.env`)

You can install the dependencies with:

```bash
pip install mysql-connector-python python-dotenv
```

## Usage

### Command-Line Arguments

This script accepts two command-line arguments:

1. **SQLite3 Database File Path**: The path to the SQLite3 database file.
2. **Table Name**: The name of the table to be migrated.

### Running the Script

Run the script as follows:

```bash
python script.py <sqlite_db_path> <sqlite_table_name>
```

For example:

```bash
python script.py /path/to/your_sqlite_db.db your_table_name
```

### Example:

```bash
python script.py /var/data/fail3ban_server.db threat_table
```

### What the Script Does:

1. **Step 1**: Dumps the specified table from the SQLite3 database into an SQL file (`sqlite_dump.sql`).
2. **Step 2**: Converts the SQL dump into a MariaDB-compatible format and saves it as `mariadb_dump.sql`.
3. **Step 3**: Imports the converted SQL dump into the MariaDB database specified in the environment variables.

### Output:

- The SQLite dump is saved in `sqlite_dump.sql`.
- The MariaDB-compatible SQL dump is saved in `mariadb_dump.sql`.
- The table is imported into the MariaDB database specified in the `.env` file.

## Error Handling

- If any SQL command fails during the import to MariaDB, the error message and failed command are printed.
- Ensure that the SQLite database and table exist before running the script.
- The `.env` file must be correctly configured with the appropriate MariaDB connection details.

## Logging

The script prints the following to the console:

- Success messages for loading environment variables and completing various steps.
- Error messages if any issues arise during execution (e.g., connection problems, SQL execution errors).

## Troubleshooting

1. **Environment Variables Not Loaded**: 
   If the `.env` file is not loaded correctly, check that the file exists in the home directory (`$HOME/.env`) and contains the required environment variables.

2. **MariaDB Connection Issues**: 
   If the connection to MariaDB fails, verify that the host, port, username, password, and database are correct in the `.env` file.

3. **SQLite Table Not Found**: 
   If the specified SQLite table is not found, ensure the table name is correct and exists in the provided SQLite database.
