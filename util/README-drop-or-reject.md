When you're sending a `DROP` (typically in networking or firewall contexts), and the other end keeps retrying because it doesn't receive any feedback, the better approach is often to use **`REJECT`** instead of `DROP`. 

### Why Use `REJECT`?
- **`DROP`**: Silently drops the packet, causing the sender to wait and eventually retry, thinking the packet was lost. This behavior can be inefficient and lead to unnecessary retries, especially if the sender doesn't know why the communication failed.
- **`REJECT`**: Sends back an error response to the sender, indicating that the packet was intentionally rejected. This gives immediate feedback to the sender, and they can stop retrying.

### Typical Message Types for `REJECT`:
- **ICMP `port-unreachable`**: If the communication is over a UDP connection, you can send an ICMP `port-unreachable` message, informing the sender that the destination is unreachable on that port.
- **TCP `RST` (Reset)**: For TCP connections, you can send a TCP reset (RST), which effectively closes the connection and informs the sender that the connection is not allowed.

### Example in `iptables`:
If you’re working with `iptables`, here’s how you can implement a `REJECT` rule:

- **For TCP Connections (send TCP RST):**
  ```bash
  iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset
  ```

- **For UDP Connections (send ICMP `port-unreachable`):**
  ```bash
  iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 53 -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-port-unreachable
  ```

### Benefits of Using `REJECT`:
- **Immediate feedback**: The sender knows right away that the communication is not allowed, preventing retries.
- **More efficient**: It avoids the unnecessary network traffic caused by repeated retries.

By returning a `REJECT` message (with an appropriate response like TCP RST or ICMP unreachable), the sender gets a clear signal, and retries should stop.
