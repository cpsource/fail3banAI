If you've forgotten the password to phpMyAdmin and need to reset or delete the database and start again, here are the steps you can follow. It assumes you have access to the underlying MySQL or MariaDB database as an administrator (e.g., via the command line). If not, you'll need to reset your root password first.

### 1. **Reset the MySQL/MariaDB Root Password (if necessary)**:
If you can't access phpMyAdmin because you don't remember the root password for MySQL/MariaDB, you’ll need to reset it:

#### For Linux Systems:
1. Stop the MySQL/MariaDB service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop mysql
   ```

2. Start MySQL/MariaDB in safe mode:
   ```bash
   sudo mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables &
   ```

3. Log into MySQL/MariaDB without a password:
   ```bash
   mysql -u root
   ```

4. Once inside the MySQL prompt, change the root password:
   ```sql
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'new_password';
   ```

5. Exit and restart the MySQL service:
   ```bash
   exit
   sudo systemctl start mysql
   ```

#### For Windows Systems:
1. Stop the MySQL service via Services (`services.msc`).
2. Start MySQL in safe mode:
   ```bash
   mysqld --skip-grant-tables
   ```
3. Open a new command prompt and log in to MySQL without a password:
   ```bash
   mysql -u root
   ```

4. Follow steps 4 and 5 as outlined above.

### 2. **Access phpMyAdmin via the Command Line**:
Once you’ve reset the root password (if needed), you can access MySQL/MariaDB directly from the command line to delete the phpMyAdmin database and start over.

#### Log into MySQL or MariaDB from the terminal:
```bash
mysql -u root -p
```

### 3. **List All Databases**:
```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
```
You should see a list of all the databases. Look for `phpmyadmin` or `pma` if it exists.

### 4. **Drop/Delete the Database**:
To completely delete the `phpmyadmin` database:
```sql
DROP DATABASE phpmyadmin;
```
Or, if the database has a different name (e.g., `pma`):
```sql
DROP DATABASE pma;
```

### 5. **Recreate the phpMyAdmin Database (if necessary)**:
If you intend to reinstall phpMyAdmin or use it again, you can recreate the `phpmyadmin` database using the setup scripts that typically come with the phpMyAdmin package:
   - Download and install phpMyAdmin again, and it should guide you through setting up the necessary tables.

### 6. **Reconfigure phpMyAdmin**:
You can now reconfigure phpMyAdmin from scratch, including setting a new admin password.

#### If you just want to **delete everything** and start fresh:
1. Drop all databases (if you wish to remove all of them):
   ```sql
   DROP DATABASE database_name;
   ```

2. You can then install phpMyAdmin from scratch and recreate your databases.
