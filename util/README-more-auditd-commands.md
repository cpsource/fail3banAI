Yes, while the `connect()` system call is the most common method used to establish **outgoing TCP connections**, there are other ways that can indirectly result in an outgoing TCP connection. These are less common but can still be exploited or used by specific types of applications. Here’s a breakdown of other methods that might result in outgoing TCP connections:

### 1. **`sendto()` and `sendmsg()` System Calls**

- **`sendto()`** and **`sendmsg()`** are often used to send data over a socket without requiring a prior `connect()`. These calls are usually used with connectionless protocols like UDP but can still be used with TCP.
  
  - **`sendto()`**: Sends a message to a specific destination (can create an implicit connection).
  - **`sendmsg()`**: More general than `sendto()`, this can send data and ancillary data.

  If the application uses **raw sockets** (which are typically used for lower-level networking tasks), these calls could result in outgoing traffic without a traditional `connect()`.

  **Example Audit Rule**:
  
  You could monitor `sendto()` or `sendmsg()` for similar auditing:

  ```bash
  sudo auditctl -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S sendto -k sendto-monitoring
  sudo auditctl -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S sendmsg -k sendmsg-monitoring
  ```

### 2. **Raw Sockets (Bypassing `connect()`)**

Applications can use **raw sockets** to send custom IP packets. This does not necessarily require the `connect()` call. Raw sockets allow applications to craft their own TCP/IP headers, which can result in an outgoing connection without invoking the traditional socket `connect()`.

Raw sockets are typically used in network utilities like `ping`, `traceroute`, or custom network protocols. They require elevated privileges (root access) because of their potential security implications.

To monitor processes that create raw sockets, you could audit the `socket()` system call when the `SOCK_RAW` option is passed.

**Example Audit Rule for Raw Sockets**:

```bash
sudo auditctl -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S socket -F a0=2 -F a1=3 -k raw-socket-monitoring
```

- **`a0=2`**: This corresponds to the `AF_INET` address family (IPv4).
- **`a1=3`**: This corresponds to the `SOCK_RAW` type (raw socket).
  
This rule will log any process that tries to create a raw socket using `socket()`.

### 3. **`accept()` on a Bound Socket**

Though **`accept()`** is typically used for incoming connections (i.e., a server listens for and accepts connections), in some cases, it could indirectly result in outgoing traffic. For instance, once a connection is accepted, the server may initiate outgoing traffic as part of the established TCP session.

You can audit the use of `accept()` in the same way you would `connect()`.

**Example Audit Rule**:

```bash
sudo auditctl -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S accept -k accept-monitoring
```

This will audit the use of `accept()` system calls.

### 4. **`fork()` or `exec()` Creating Child Processes**

A process that calls `connect()` might be hidden in child processes spawned by the original program. In this case, the parent process doesn’t initiate the connection, but a child process created using `fork()` or `exec()` does.

You can track `fork()` and `execve()` system calls, which can help detect when a new process is created and might be initiating outgoing connections.

**Example Audit Rule**:

```bash
sudo auditctl -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S fork -k fork-monitoring
sudo auditctl -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S execve -k exec-monitoring
```

### 5. **`iptables` Redirects or Proxies**

In some cases, a connection may appear as a **direct outgoing TCP connection** but is actually being redirected or proxied using firewall rules (e.g., `iptables` with `REDIRECT` or `NAT`). This can mask the original source of the outgoing connection.

You can monitor changes to `iptables` or other firewall configurations by auditing system calls like `iptables` or `nftables` invocations.

**Example Audit Rule for `iptables` Changes**:

```bash
sudo auditctl -w /usr/sbin/iptables -p x -k iptables-monitoring
```

This rule will monitor any execution of the `iptables` command, which may change firewall rules and impact network traffic.

### 6. **TCP SYN Flooding (Low-level Packet Generation)**

Low-level utilities that generate raw packets to perform tasks like **TCP SYN flooding** can create outbound TCP SYN packets without a full TCP connection establishment (`connect()`). Such utilities use raw sockets or `pcap` libraries to create custom packets.

To audit these, you’d need to focus on tools using raw sockets or specific processes known to perform such actions (e.g., DDoS tools or testing utilities).

### Conclusion:

While `connect()` is the primary method for creating outgoing TCP connections, you can use other system calls and methods to generate network traffic, including:
- **`sendto()` and `sendmsg()`**
- **Raw sockets**
- **Indirect connections via child processes using `fork()` or `exec()`**
- **Redirections or proxies through firewall rules (`iptables`)**
- **Low-level packet crafting tools**

You can monitor most of these activities with `auditd` rules by auditing the relevant system calls (`socket`, `sendto`, `fork`, etc.). Depending on your use case, you may need a combination of rules to capture different types of outgoing traffic.

Let me know if you need help setting up any specific audit rule!
