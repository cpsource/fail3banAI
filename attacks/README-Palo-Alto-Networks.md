### What Is Expanse by Palo Alto Networks?
Expanse is a security company (now part of Palo Alto Networks) that scans the global IPv4 space multiple times per day to identify and map organizations' presences on the internet. Their goal is to help customers identify exposed services, assets, or vulnerabilities across their public-facing infrastructure. The user agent string suggests that the request is part of their scanning activity.

### What You Can Do About It:
1. **Decide if You Want to Block the IP**:
   - If you don't want Expanse scanning your website, you can choose to block their IP address (`198.235.24.156`) using `iptables`, `ufw`, or by configuring your web server (Apache, Nginx, etc.).
   - **Example `iptables` command to block the IP**:
     ```bash
     sudo iptables -A INPUT -s 198.235.24.156 -j DROP
     ```

2. **Contact Expanse to Opt Out**:
   - The user agent string explicitly provides contact information (`scaninfo@paloaltonetworks.com`) if you would like to be excluded from their scans.
   - You can send them an email requesting that your IP address or domain be removed from their scanning.

   **Example Email to Expanse**:
   ```text
   Subject: Opt-out Request from Expanse Scans

   Hello,

   I would like to request that my IP address(es)/domain(s) be excluded from your scanning activity. Below are the details:

   IP Address/Domain: [Your IP address or domain]

   Thank you for your cooperation.

   Regards,
   [Your Name]
   [Your Organization]
   ```

3. **Monitor the Scans**:
   - You can monitor your access logs to see if there are repeated scans from this IP or similar activity from other Expanse IP addresses.
   - If these scans are causing performance issues or if you believe they are unnecessary, opting out or blocking their IP may be the best course of action.

4. **Allow the Scan**:
   - If you're comfortable with the scan and see no harm in it, you can allow the request. Expanse's scans are generally non-malicious and are often used by organizations for visibility into their internet-facing assets.

### Summary of Actions:
- **Block the IP** if you don't want to be scanned.
- **Contact Expanse** at `scaninfo@paloaltonetworks.com` to request exclusion.
- Continue monitoring your logs for similar requests.

Ultimately, it's your decision whether you allow or block these scans, but Expanse's scans are generally legitimate and used by organizations to secure their infrastructure.
