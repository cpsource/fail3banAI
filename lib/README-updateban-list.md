## Update the work load we have to do

# What we do

We first fetch a new ipsum.3.txt, then we compare it to our old one.

We get two lists from chk.py, the first being ip's to add to ipset,
and the secondis a list of ip's to remove from ipset.

# In /tmp

Eventually, this code will be integrated into the mainline
