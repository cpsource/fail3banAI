This entry in the Apache2 `access.log` shows an unusual and potentially malicious request made to your server. Here’s a breakdown of the entry:

```
65.49.1.73 - - [03/Oct/2024:14:35:17 +0000] "\x16\x03\x01" 400 488 "-" "-"
```

### Breakdown:

- **65.49.1.73**: The IP address of the client making the request. This IP address is located at the start of the log entry.
- **- -**: These two hyphens are placeholders. The first represents the identity of the user making the request (which is usually blank in most logs), and the second is the authenticated username (also blank, meaning no authentication was provided).
- **[03/Oct/2024:14:35:17 +0000]**: The timestamp of the request. It shows the exact date and time (in UTC format) when this request was made.
- **"\x16\x03\x01"**: This is the actual request made by the client. However, it is not a normal HTTP request. `\x16\x03\x01` represents binary data sent to the server. This typically indicates an attempt to communicate using an SSL/TLS handshake to an endpoint that isn't expecting it (likely on port 80, which is for HTTP rather than HTTPS).
- **400**: The HTTP response code. In this case, `400` means "Bad Request," indicating the server couldn’t understand the request due to malformed syntax (in this case, possibly because binary data was sent to a port expecting HTTP).
- **488**: The size of the response in bytes that the server returned to the client.
- **"-" "-"**: The first dash represents the `Referer` field (left empty in this case, meaning no referring URL). The second dash represents the `User-Agent` field, which is also left blank, suggesting the client either did not provide or intentionally omitted these headers.

### What It Means:
- The `\x16\x03\x01` indicates an attempt to establish an SSL/TLS handshake, which suggests that the client tried to connect to an HTTP port (likely port 80) using an HTTPS protocol. This commonly happens when a client mistakenly tries to access an HTTP server with HTTPS or when automated scanning tools or bots are probing your server for vulnerabilities.
- The `400` status code means the server properly rejected the invalid request.

This entry doesn't necessarily indicate an attack, but it could represent automated probing or a misconfigured client. If you see many such entries, it might be worth investigating further or filtering out such traffic.
