Backup and Restore SQLite3 Database
This guide covers the steps to backup and restore an SQLite3 database using SQLite commands or simple file copying methods.

Backup SQLite3 Database
An SQLite3 database is stored in a single file, making it easy to back up using two methods: file copying or the SQLite .backup command.

Method 1: Simple File Copy
You can back up the database by copying the database file directly using standard file commands.

Example Command:
bash
Copy code
cp /path/to/your-database.db /path/to/backup/backup-database.db
Alternatively, you can use rsync:

bash
Copy code
rsync -av /path/to/your-database.db /path/to/backup/backup-database.db
Method 2: Using SQLite Shell .backup
You can back up the database while it's in use using the .backup command in the SQLite shell.

Open the SQLite3 shell:

bash
Copy code
sqlite3 /path/to/your-database.db
Run the .backup command:

bash
Copy code
.backup /path/to/backup/backup-database.db
Exit the shell:

bash
Copy code
.exit
Restore SQLite3 Database
Restoring a database can be done by copying the backup file back to the original location or by using the .restore command in the SQLite shell.

Method 1: Simple File Copy
To restore the database, simply copy the backup file over the original file:

bash
Copy code
cp /path/to/backup/backup-database.db /path/to/your-database.db
Method 2: Using SQLite Shell .restore
To restore using the SQLite shell:

Open the SQLite3 shell:

bash
Copy code
sqlite3 /path/to/your-database.db
Run the .restore command:

bash
Copy code
.restore /path/to/backup/backup-database.db
Exit the shell:

bash
Copy code
.exit
Checking Database Consistency
To ensure that your SQLite database is consistent and free of corruption, you can use PRAGMA integrity_check.

Open the SQLite3 shell:

bash
Copy code
sqlite3 /path/to/your-database.db
Run the integrity check:

sql
Copy code
PRAGMA integrity_check;
The result should be ok if the database is consistent.

If there are any issues with the database, the result will provide details on the corruption.

Recovering from Corruption
If the database is corrupted, you can attempt to recover it by exporting the data and re-importing it into a new database.

Export the corrupted database:

bash
Copy code
sqlite3 /path/to/corrupt-database.db ".output backup.sql" ".dump" ".exit"
Create a new database:

bash
Copy code
sqlite3 /path/to/new-database.db ".read backup.sql" ".exit"
Run PRAGMA integrity_check on the new database to ensure it is consistent.
